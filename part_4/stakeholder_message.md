Hi Stakeholder,

I got the questions you sent along with the data files but unfortunately the data quality isn't great and in the current state I can't get you accurate answers to those questions.   The biggest issue I'm seeing is that there is a bunch of data missing about which brands correspond to each barcode.  Do you know where I could find that data?  If not, where did you get this data?  Maybe I can track down a more complete dataset and fill in some of the gaps.

There is also a discrepancy between the total spend and items purchased at the receipt level versus adding up the items in receipt detail but I think using the detail is probably more accurate unless you can think of any reason it wouldn't be.  The spend totals are consistently higher using the calculation approach and the only item counts that are not higher seem like an error so I think it is a pretty safe bet but please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Austin
